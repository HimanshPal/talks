# Dive into PHP 7

We all eventually gave up discussing that famous article describing PHP's bad design, bought our t-shirts and got on with our lives. Some of us decided to give Ruby a go. Or Go. We all know PHP is far from perfect but it's still one of the most popular languages on the web (thanks Wordpress!) so... just get on with it. Right?

Wrong!

There's a new kid in town. And it deserves your attention. Shame no more. Because PHP is not done yet!

Over 10 years since its last major release, PHP 7 is now out and available. Heck, we're at 7.0.5 already! All this hard work, sweat, tears and swearing in the community brought us significant performance improvements, drastically reduced memory consumption, a brand spanking new Zend Engine and a host of new language features to make PHP shine again.

Let's take a look at what's new. If you didn't get a chance to play around with PHP 7 yet I'll (hopefully) do the homework for you. If you're an expert already, looking forward to hearing what you think!
